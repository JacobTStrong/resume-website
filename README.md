## About

I chose to make a resume website to help me practice HTML and stylesheets. This particular resume is what I would come up with if I were to apply for a job at a music store! Nothing fancy, simply for practice.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Locate the resume.html file.
* Open the resume.html file to view the webpage!

## Known Bugs

* This isn't necessarily a bug, but this is actually the second repository I made for this project. Unfortunately, I ran into a few issues making new commits to the initial repository. After searching my notes, class material, and the internet, I came up empty-handed and decided to create a new repository. I'm sure there is an easy explanation.
* No known bugs!
